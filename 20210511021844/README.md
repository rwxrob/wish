# Redo Browsersync in Go

The Node.js tool Browsersync is one of the best Node applications ever
created. It is virtually a standard for all web front-end development.
Problem is, that there is no reason it had to be in Node. It needs a
rewrite in Go so that I don't have to install Node just to use this one
amazing application. It is the only must-have Node application in my
toolbox.
