# Terminal Typing Training

All the web tools are lame. Even those designed for coding suck pretty
badly. There needs to be an exciting terminal typing training tool that
allows all the keys a technologist needs to be learned. By creating
snippets in a given language it can double as a method of familiarizing
oneself with a particular language syntax while at it.

I'd like to write it in Go using the `cview` GUI library.
