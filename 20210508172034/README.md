# A `screenkey` Version Using `tty` Not X Windows

The current amazing `screenkey` tool that prints every keystroke to the
screen currently reads from the graphic X windows system in order to do
that. I get why that is. But I also wish they had looked directly at the
`tty` device instead then it work from TMUX sessions as well. Oh well.
Maybe someone will make a version that does some day. I can only wish.
