# Namecheap Command Line Interface

I use Namecheap a lot when looking up domains. It would be nice to have
a better search capability from the command line than the horrible
graphic user interface. There's probably an API that we could leverage
to do it and, who knows, perhaps there is already a CLI tool that does
what I'm looking for. Maybe I just need to look harder.
