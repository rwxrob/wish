# Kick-Ass Educational Chemistry 3D Shooter

I've long wanted someone to take me up on the idea of creating a really
rated M educational chemistry shooter that does *smell* like a "for
education" game. It could be a full triple-A game that requires you to
prepare different ammo and weapons to fight an wildly different set of
monsters and mobs using the right stuff. There could be a chem lab where
you see the periodic table in 3D, play around with simulated
combinations of all the chemicals to learn about their properties and
more.

Hell, just a realistic chem lab that taught about what happens when you
combine different chemicals would be amazing.
