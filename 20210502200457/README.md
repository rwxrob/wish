# KEG, A Decentralized Knowledge Grid/Graph

I have been working on KEG for several years, something to replace or
supplement the world wide web that maintains the motivations of the
original web: knowledge exchange. It will leverage the infrastructure of
the web without depending on it. It will provide localized content
searching through semantic structuring, parsing, and local caching. It
won't even need a network. It will provide digitally-signed attribution
of authorship. It will use trust to improve content discovery.
