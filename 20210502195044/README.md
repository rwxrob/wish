# Nark, An Open-Source "Tripwire" Replacement Idea

The original [tripwire] seems to be alive and well. However, it looks
like it could use an update and perhaps a rewrite in a modern language
(like Go or Rust). I'd also like to focus on the reporting aspect above
all and add both inbound and outbound ports to the monitor to "nark" on
(get it) stuff that is not supposed to be on my system.

Another consideration would be the license change from GPLv2 to Apache.

What a great project this is for learning a specific language as well?
It's practical, uses tech and techniques that are relevant, and it's
relatively simple to implement.
