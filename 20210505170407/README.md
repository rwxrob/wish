# Get Lynx to Process Saved Links as Zet

By default it saves them to an ancient bookmark file in what is not
completely invalid HTML. Lynx has the ability to map keys to different
subshell commands and I'm thinking this can be used to hijack `a` to
pass the current URL through a script of my own that filters the input
and passes it to `web` (or something, multicall to `zet`) that I can use
anytime I want to save a resource from the web for searching in my own
way later.
